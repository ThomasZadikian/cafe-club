Side Project for Personal Use

This project is divided into two folders:

1 - The "back" folder contains all the backend dependencies (node modules for Express).
2 - The "front" folder contains all the dependencies for React.

Within the "front" package, you will find an npm start command that launches both the Express server and the React project. Please note that this won't work until you set up the database on your localhost.

The project utilizes create-react-app and Express.js. As the database is not hosted online, its usage is restricted. However, please feel free to utilize this project as you see fit; it was developed by a junior developer.

If you decide to clone this project, remember to run npm install in order to install the necessary dependencies.
